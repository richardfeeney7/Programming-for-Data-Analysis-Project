# Introduction

### Project Outline And Objectives
<div align="justify"> For this project I must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing. I can pick any phenomenon I wish that take in the following four points : 
</div>
<div align="justify">
1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.<br>
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.<br>
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.<br>
4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### How To Run Project
<div align="justify">
1. Download Cmder command line or use the command line on your computer. (Please note that this project uses JS that might not display on github<br>
2. Go to Github, find my repository or use the following link https://github.com/richardfeeney7/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project then click on the Clone/Download button and select download zip. <br>
3. Once downloaded go to the command line and navigate to this  download using the cd command. When I download the zip file, I first had to unzip it and cd into it, and within that folder I had another folder that I need to cd into also.<br><br>
4. Once in the correct location type Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook into the command like. This will open a web server where you can access the files. Depending on the settings this might open Internet Explorer, I would recommend closing that web page and use the web address that you can see in the command line. <br>
5. When you open the web server and can view my project file, open the <u><b><i>.ipynb</i></b></u> document to view the project. <br><br>
6. See the below photo of steps that I took, please note that your machine and downloads might be in a different location.
